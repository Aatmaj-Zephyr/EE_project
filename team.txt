Timeline
1) UI Designing in Figma- 	December First week
UI designing wil be done for the entire scope of the project 
2) LED blinking with arduino -  Jan second week	- 

issues of pairing app with bluetooth (mobile control) as well as pairing app with
bluetooth module. will be taken into consideration. 
https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/mayooghgirish/arduino-bluetooth-basic-tutorial-d8b737
This will requrire time and vacations can be utilized for it.
Testing of the prototype will be done on hardware.
The app made will be built in APk format.

This will be done by Tejas, Taher and Kavya
 
3) Basic UI implemntation- 			Feb First week		Tejas
4) Backend Arduino complete-			Feb First week		Kavya
5) Basic NodeJS backend complete-      		Feb First week		Taher
6) Apk app deployment of basic structure.	Feb Second week         Tejas
7) Testing of the app on hardware		Feb Third week          Kavya
8) Bug fixing 					Feb last week		Tejas Taher Kavya


Measures taken to lower risk
1) Bluetoth working prototype- First prototype will send information over the bluetooth, solving issues like pairing and app+arduino connectivity
2) Smoke testing - Build will be made every week by Tejas.
