Simple use case

This project aims at improving eye hand coordination among chilren. It is an active toy which can be played to improve eye hand coordination. There are 7 color coded buttons and one RGB LED strip. The setup is controlled by an app using wifi. All this is covered in a durable user friendly chasis. The RGB LED displays one color. The user has to press the button corresponding to the same color. The same process is repeated over again at a rapid pace. This sort of game can be used to increase reaction time as well as eye hand coordination.
